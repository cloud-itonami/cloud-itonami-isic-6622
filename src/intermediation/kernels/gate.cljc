(ns intermediation.kernels.gate
  "Safety kernel for the insurance-intermediation governor + phase gate
  — the decision CORE of `intermediation.governor/check` and
  `intermediation.phase/gate`, extracted into the safe-kotoba subset
  (cloud-itonami kernels discipline, ADR-0016 / superproject
  ADR-2607101200).

  Everything here is integer-coded and stays inside the emit-ready
  vocabulary: `defn`, `def` constants, nested `if`, `=`, `<`, integer
  arithmetic, recursion-free composition through named combinators. No
  keywords, strings, maps, atoms, host interop or I/O — the façades
  (`intermediation.governor`, `intermediation.phase`) reduce their
  inputs to flags/codes at the boundary and map the result codes back
  to keywords. `.kotoba`/wasm emission is deliberately NOT wired yet
  (owner decision 2026-07-12: ClojureScript + kotoba-datomic first);
  staying inside the subset is what keeps that door open without a
  rewrite.

  Wire codes:
    flag        0 = no, anything else = yes (norm-flag, fail-closed)
    confidence  int x100 (0..100); out-of-range counts as LOW (fail-closed)
    quote-count plain int (a count is already an integer)
    rate/cap    int x10000 (basis points; the façade rounds via
                Math/round, so rates/caps with <= 4 decimals — every
                value in `intermediation.facts` and the demo store —
                are exact)
    op          0 read (this repo's read-ops set is EMPTY, so the façade
                never produces 0 — the code is kept for the fleet-wide
                wire contract and reads pass through if one ever appears)
                1 :placement/intake         2 :jurisdiction/assess
                3 :conflict/screen          4 :placement/bind
                5 :commission/book          6+ unknown write (never enabled)
    phase       0..3 (anything else: no writes at all — the façade
                normalizes unknown phases to its own default BEFORE the
                kernel, so an out-of-range phase reaching the kernel is
                a bug and fails closed)
    verdict     0 ok/commit-eligible  1 escalate  2 hard-hold
    disposition 0 commit  1 escalate  2 hold
    reason      0 none  1 phase-disabled  2 phase-approval

  Fail-closed direction: every invalid/unknown input degrades toward
  LESS autonomy (hold/escalate), never more. `:placement/bind` (op 4)
  and `:commission/book` (op 5) are auto-enabled at NO phase — the
  same structural invariant the phase table and the governor's
  actuation gate state independently (placing real coverage and
  booking a real commission are always a human broker's call)."
